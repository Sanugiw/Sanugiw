## About Me

I’m a highly motivated and disciplined second-year **Biomedical Engineering undergraduate at the University of Moratuwa**, maintaining a CGPA of **3.9/4.0** with consistent placement on the **Dean’s List** for academic excellence. I have a strong passion for solving complex healthcare challenges through interdisciplinary approaches that combine **signal processing**, **physiological modeling**, **machine learning**, and **human-computer interaction**.

My academic journey is enriched by hands-on experience in building **medical devices** and **intelligent software systems** that enhance diagnostic accuracy and clinical efficiency. I bring a strong blend of **hardware integration**, **algorithm development**, and **user-centered design**, aiming to create impactful, accessible solutions that improve patient care and promote global health equity.

Beyond the classroom, I’m actively involved in leadership and technical roles within several organizations including the **Electronic Club**, **IEEE EMBS Student Branch Chapter of University of Moratuwa**, **IEEE Student Branch of University of Moratuwa**, and **AIESEC in University of Moratuwa**. These experiences have helped sharpen my communication, project management, and team collaboration skills — vital tools for a future biomedical innovator.

I am continuously seeking opportunities to engage in **research**, collaborate on **multidisciplinary projects**, and explore how emerging technologies can be translated into **real-world biomedical solutions**.
