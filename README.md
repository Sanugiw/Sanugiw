### About

I’m a **third-year Biomedical Engineering undergraduate** at the **Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa**, maintaining a **CGPA of 3.87/4.0** with consistent placement on the **Dean’s List** for academic excellence.

My passion lies in solving real-world healthcare challenges through the intersection of **medical instrumentation**, **biosignal processing**, **machine learning**, and **machine vision**. I’m driven by the goal of designing intelligent, human-centered systems that make healthcare more accessible, efficient, and data-driven.

Throughout my academic journey, I’ve developed a range of projects; from **X-Hale**, a portable spirometer with mobile app integration, and **ML-Integrated Table-Mounted Fundoscope**, to the **Dual Mode Analog Thermometer** and **MediBox**, an IoT-based medicine reminder. These experiences have strengthened my skills in **circuit design**, **sensor interfacing**, **signal conditioning**, **feature extraction**, **machine learning model development**, and **embedded systems integration**.

Beyond the lab, I actively contribute to organizations such as the **IEEE EMBS, IEEE Student Branch, and AIESEC at the University of Moratuwa**, taking on leadership and organizational roles that have refined my teamwork, communication, and project management skills. I am also passionate about writing and knowledge sharing, using it as a platform to communicate ideas, inspire peers, and contribute to the broader scientific and technical community.

I’m continuously exploring opportunities to collaborate on research and innovation-driven projects that bridge technology and medicine; with a vision to advance biomedical engineering through creativity, data, and human-centered design.
