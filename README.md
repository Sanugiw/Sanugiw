## Sanugi Dilara Wickramasinghe

I am a highly motivated and disciplined third year **Biomedical Engineering undergraduate at the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa**, maintaining a CGPA of **3.9/4.0** with consistent placement on the **Deanâ€™s List** for academic excellence. I am passionate about solving complex healthcare challenges through interdisciplinary approaches that combine **Mathematics**, **Physiological Modeling**, **Bio Signal Processing**, and **Machine Learning**.

My academic journey is defined by hands-on experience in developing **medical devices** and **intelligent software systems** that enhance diagnostic precision and clinical efficiency. With a strong foundation in **hardware integration**, **algorithm development**, and **user-centered design**, I strive to create accessible, impactful solutions that advance patient care and global health. My key projects include **X-Hale** (a portable spirometer with mobile app integration), **ML Integrated Table Mounted Fundoscope**, **Dual Mode Analog Thermometer**, and **MediBox** (an IoT-based medicine reminder).

Beyond the classroom, I am actively involved in leadership and technical roles within several organizations including the **Electronic Club**, **IEEE EMBS Student Branch Chapter of University of Moratuwa**, **IEEE Student Branch of University of Moratuwa**, and **AIESEC in University of Moratuwa**. These experiences have helped sharpen my communication, project management, and team collaboration skills; vital tools for a future biomedical innovator.

I am continuously seeking opportunities to engage in **research**, collaborate on **multidisciplinary projects**, and explore how emerging technologies can be translated into **real-world biomedical solutions**.
