### About

I’m a third-year Biomedical Engineering undergraduate at the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa, with consistent placement on the Dean’s List.

I’m passionate about applying engineering and data-driven approaches to address healthcare challenges, particularly in medical instrumentation, biosignal processing, and machine learning and machine vision for healthcare applications. My experience spans developing biomedical devices, sensor-based systems, and intelligent healthcare tools that integrate hardware, software, and machine learning models to improve diagnostic precision and accessibility.

Beyond academics, I value clear communication, leadership, and teamwork, which I’ve strengthened through active engagement in technical and professional initiatives. I have a strong appreciation for reading, as well as technical and creative writing. These interests fuel my curiosity and enhance my ability to communicate ideas thoughtfully and effectively.

Driven by curiosity and compassion, I aim to contribute to innovative, human-centered healthcare solutions through research and multidisciplinary collaboration.
